# jv-write-bytes-to-file

We will practice with writing array of bytes to the file.
Let's implement method: `writeBytesToFile(String fileName, byte[] data)` with two parameters:
- `String fileName` - you should create file with with name and write array of bytes there.
- `byte[] data` - your data.

Don't convert bytes to String! Let's write `byte[]` directly to file.
